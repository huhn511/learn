# Diátaxis

> https://diataxis.fr

A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.

Diátaxis is a way of thinking about and doing documentation.

It prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.

- Tutorials: A tutorial is an experience that takes place under the guidance of a tutor. A tutorial is always learning-oriented.
- How-to guides: How-to guides are directions that guide the reader through a problem or towards a result. How-to guides are goal-oriented.
- Reference: Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is information-oriented.
- Explanation: Explanation is a discursive treatment of a subject, that permits reflection. Explanation is understanding-oriented.
