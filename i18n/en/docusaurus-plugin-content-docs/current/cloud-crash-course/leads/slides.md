### **Slide 3: Visualization - Public, Private and Hybrid Cloud**
#### **Diagram: Three pillars with explanations**
- **Public Cloud:**
- Resources are provided by an external provider (e.g. AWS, Stackit).
- Benefits: cost efficiency, instant access, global scalability.
- Challenge: data security and dependency on the provider.

- **Private Cloud:**
- Dedicated infrastructure, either on-premises or with a provider (e.g. Stackit's Private Cloud).
- Advantages: High control, strong security measures, tailor-made.
- Challenge: Higher costs and maintenance effort.

- **Hybrid Cloud:**
- Combination of both models, flexibly scalable.
- Advantages: Balance between security and scalability.
- Challenge: Complexity in management.

#### **Visualization:**
- Three colored bars with symbols representing public, private and hybrid cloud.
- Under each bar: Key features (3-4 points per model).
